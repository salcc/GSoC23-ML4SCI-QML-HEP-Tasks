    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The two graph-based architectures I decided to implement are Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and ParticleNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, I decided to implement the GCN, as introduced in the seminal paper [2][3], because it is one of the most popular graph neural network architectures and serves as the foundation for numerous other graph-based architectures. Secondly, I researched about what are the specific graph neural networks architectures for classifying jets, and I found a recent presentation about jet flavor identification at in the CMS Experiment at CERN [4], which compared several architectures and stated that ParticleNet [5][6] was the one obtaining the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will implement both architectures using PyTorch [7], as it is my preferred deep learning library. I have opted not to utilize libraries such as PyTorch Geometric, which offer methods for training GNNs more easily, for example by including pre-built graph convolutional layers. My intention with this is to demonstrate how the architectures can be implemented from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also use the NumPy [8], SciPy 2-D sparse array  [9] and scikit-learn [10] libraries to perform some operations to process the data."
